CurAItor – AI-Powered Virtual Art Museum
CurAItor is an AI-powered virtual museum that brings art to everyone, anywhere. Our project reimagines how people engage with art by creating personalized, interactive, and accessible experiences.

🚀 Inspiration
We love art and the joy of visiting museums, but we wanted to bring that experience to everyone, everywhere—especially those who may not have easy access to physical galleries.

Our mission is to:
✨ Connect people of all abilities with art that speaks to them
📚 Enhance art education and make learning more engaging
🌍 Make art more inclusive and accessible

With CurAItor, you can explore your own unique AI-curated art gallery, anytime, anywhere! 🖼️

🎭 What It Does
CurAItor is an AI-powered virtual museum that generates a curated collection of real artworks based on user input.

🔍 Users enter a prompt or concept—AI curates a collection of existing art pieces that match their vision
🏛️ 3D virtual museum—Users can explore AI-selected art in an interactive space
🤣 Humorous AI-generated descriptions make learning about art fun and engaging
🔊 Text-to-speech support ensures accessibility for visually impaired users

🛠️ How We Built It
🔹 Tech Stack:
Front-end: JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS

Back-end: Python, Flask

AI Models: Cohere, Command-R, OpenAI GPT-4.0 (text-to-speech)

3D Virtual Museum: Open-source framework integrated into our UI

🔹 How It Works:
User enters a description or concept (e.g., "dreamy landscapes")

AI selects real artworks that align with the concept

3D virtual museum displays the curated pieces

AI generates fun descriptions and provides text-to-speech narration
